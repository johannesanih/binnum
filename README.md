# binnum
**Base10 to Binary (Base2) converter**
Binnum converts base10 numbers to base2 numbers, it is still a console based application, (you will have to run on cmd)
# Using Binnum
1. Clone the github repository or you can also download the whole thing
2. using a command line navigate to the folder where you have the binnum.py file
3. on your command line run **python binnum.py**
4. You will be prompted to input the base10 number you wish to convert
5. You will also be asked if you want to convert a whole range or you want to convert only that particular number, it is a yes or no question [Y/N] which you will answer with either "**Y**" or "**N**"
6. If you want to convert a whole range, it would convert all numbers from zero to any number you choose

# Future Binnum
This is just a simple project idea, which I would love to develop on, so you should expect this from future versions of binnum
1. **Ability to convert from base10 to base2 and vice versa**
2. **Ability to convert from any base to any base**
3. **And finally a GUI**
